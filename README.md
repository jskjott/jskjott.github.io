The Resevoir is a knowledge-base dedicated to the long-term.

Resevoir started as a blog-like site in 2018 - meant to document and present already finished projects. It has grown into a place which makes Jonathan feel at home on the internet while also providing a space for him to travel through the thoughts and ideas he has had over time.

The site is still very much in flux as a result of experimenting with what structure makes for a comfortable home.
