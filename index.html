    <h3>Welcome!</h3> 
    <p> 
      In this 1st grade classroom, we'll take a closer look at a knowledge-focused, English Language Arts lesson that features a teacher reading aloud. The Read-Aloud is the core part of the Knowledge Strand, focusing on background knowledge, listening comprehension, analysis of text, and speaking and listening skills. Knowledge domains introduce new and engaging content and follow a consistent structure that allows students to build knowledge within and across domains. 
    </p>

  <div class="col">
    <strong>
    1. Review previous content and connect to the day’s lesson
      <br>
      <br>
    2. Preview core vocabulary
      <br>
      <br>
    3. Set a purpose for listening during the Read-Aloud.
    </strong>
      <br> 
      <br>
      <br>

    <p>
      Students begin each lesson reviewing new content from the previous lesson, assessing their growing comprehension through a range of literal, evaluative, and inferential questions that increase in content and skill difficulty. Students also review Prior knowledge from earlier units, activating their existing understanding and previewing vocabulary, concepts, and other information.

    <h4>Emperor's empire and the Chinampas</h4>
    <p>
      The words <i>emperor, empire, wealth, retreat </i> and <i> palace </i> are introduced in this lesson. CKLA core vocabulary words include a range of academic and domain-related vocabulary (Tiers 1, 2, and 3) that students will hear in context multiple times throughout the domain Read-Alouds. In this lesson, after the introduction of the new vocabulary, the class has a short discussion activity about <i>chinampas</i> (the farms of the Aztec people) which they learnt about in a previous class.

          <strong>Turn and Talk</strong>  During the previous lessons, you learned that the
          Maya had many different rulers, including kings and priests. How
          is the Aztec civilization different? (Unlike the Maya, the Aztec
          civilization is an empire, or a group of people and land that is ruled
          by a single ruler.)

      <br>
     <p>
        Students are read aloud an engaging narrative or informational text exposing them to new vocabulary, knowledge and language. The lessons and domains are designed to build upon each other, so that students can connect new knowledge and concepts to previous learning. During Read-Alouds, students participate in close reading strategies to develop deeper understanding.

    <h4>Moctezuma and the Arrival of the Strangers</h4>
    <p>
      In today's Read-Aloud we meet Moctezuma, the emperor of the Aztec empire. We hear about how he lives a life in prosperity. Furthermore, we witness how Moctezuma receives the news of the arrival of strangers on the shores of his empire (European colonists). As this story is told images are like the one seen on the right are shown from the Flip Book to provide more context for students to engage with the story and the knowledge it contains.

    3. Encourage oral expression

      <br>
    </strong>
    <p>
      After the Read-Aloud, rich discussion is generated based on content of the text that was just read. The varying nature of the questions-literal, inferential, and evaluative- seeks to develop the students as critically-thinking, active, curious, and discerning participants, expressing their own views while remaining rooted in the rich text.
    </p>
      <br>
    <h4>Where are the Strangers From?</h4>
    <p>
      The first comprehension question of this lesson prompts the students about where they think the "strangers" are from. To answer this question the students must work with the visual and auditory information they got during the Read-Aloud to

      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
    <p>
      Each Read-Aloud is accompanied by additional and specific vocabulary activities. During this time the class will explore in a deeper way how a key core vocabulary word from the lesson is used in the world.. In the process students acquire deeper knowledge and understanding while becoming more able to describe the world with rich vocabulary.
    </p>
      <br>
    <h4>Emperor</h4>
    <p>
      The Word Work today is focusing on the word <i>emperor</i>. In the first part of the activity the students hear more about what the word means and how it is used. They are then asked to discuss in pairs how their life would be like or what they would do if they were an emperor. The questions on the right are an example of how the lesson plan support these activities by providing additional questions and points of discussion for the class.

      Finally students apply the content they learned through a rich variety of speaking, listening, reading, and writing activities. Application activities are based on the content of the Read-Aloud. Students have the opportunity to apply their newly acquired knowledge and vocabulary in the rich context of the domain. . Application activities also provide an opportunity to check for correct use of language in context.

    <h4>A Sentence on the Aztec</h4>
    <p>
      Moctezuma and Tenochtitlan, the main city of the Aztecs,  are first added to the civilization chart that consists of the people and places the students have learnt about in previous ELA classes. In the main Application activity, students are prompted to write a sentence about something they remember and find interesting from today’s Read-Aloud. This activity concludes the Knowledge-focused part of the lesson and acts as the exit pass before the class ends.
