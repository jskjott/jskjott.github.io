          I am constantly wondering about how to create great community spaces. I strongly beieve that a community's strength and potential can be gauged by looking at the spaces a community's members share and create.

          Elevator ?itch is our attempt at creating a community event which builds on the concept of an open-mic. We create a space in which "the stage" can be any part of any given space and in which the roles of performer and audience at times are blurred. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Our motto so far has been "interact, present, perform". We decided on these three words as they drew attention to the diverse set of actions we would hope the events would attract.
          <br/>
          <br/>

          <video class="displayed" width="500px" src="assets/elevator_pitch_com.mp4" autoplay muted loop /></video>
          <br/>
          <br/>

          And indeed these events turned into something different from an open mic. Of course we had many great participants sharing their musical talents on stage.
