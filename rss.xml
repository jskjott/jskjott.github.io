			<![CDATA[ <p>Resevoir started as a blog-like site meant to to document and present already finished projects.

			It has grown into a place which makes me feel at home on the internet while also providing a space for me to travel through the thoughts and ideas I have had over time.

			The site is still very much in flux as a result of me experimenting with what structure makes me feel at home.</p> ]]>

			<![CDATA[ <p>All vehicles are ways of seeing. Every vehicle, through the way it exists in relationship to the bodies whose existence it extends, powerfully acts on their user’s worlds. They make some worlds accessible and others inaccessible, and enable the noticing of certain things while hiding others, thereby becoming a texture or aesthetic of experience.

			What gaze does a sailboat allow us to cast upon different worlds? This is a question I am only just starting to explore by sailing in dinghies on the river Thames. When in the dinghy, I see buildings through experiencing how they act on the the wind. Being in the presence of other entities on the river - The dinghy folds and twists its sail to maneuvre through the steady stream of fossil pushed crafts.</p> ]]>
