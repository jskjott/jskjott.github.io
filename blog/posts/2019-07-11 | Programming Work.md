### Goals for today:

- fix things suggested by Parthiv
- apply to minimum 1 job
- make progress on Git for Filmmakers project

### What I Ended Up Doing

- I adressed most of the things Parthiv said needed to be changed
  -	However, I did not test it and varify that everything works as it should.
- I decided to apply for the jobs at method, but then decided to revamp my portfolio
  - Therefore, I did a major redesign in which I started using markdown for the individual project pages. The cool thing is that I now know how to use modules in vue.
- Besides that I made hummus for the first time and it turned out great!
- And I swam 1200 meters in the morning.
- Another observation: I took a nap in the afternoon and that felt so good. I was much more relaxed and joyful because of that.
