Today I went swimming at the kosciuszko pool for the first time! From now on morning swimming will form the backbone of my routine. I hope to swim 25 miles by the end of August: if I do that I will get a free t-shirt ;)

I also went to Prospect park and the main branch library which lies at the opening of the park. Quite nice, though it was so hot. I will probably stay at home tomorrow.

Oh! And I solved a quite hard puzzle on codewars.
