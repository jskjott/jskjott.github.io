After a fair amount of roaming around and not wanting to get started on things, today I got more done than most of the days up till now.

Today I sucessfully:

* Pushed the status feature infrastructure to our Eye project
* I also set up this blog! I was inspired by the simplicity of [Nikita Popov](https://nikic.github.io/)'s blog
* I signed up for swimming at the nearby community pool (going for the first time tomorrow!)
* I also made Chana Masala for the first time. Yummy ^^

Now it is 10 pm and I will start to prepare for the night.
