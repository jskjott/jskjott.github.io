    <h3>Welcome!</h3> 
    <p> 
      In this Grade 1 classroom, we'll take a closer look at a skills-focused, English Language Arts lesson which features a range of activities that reinforce and develop students' foundational literacy skills. Skills lessons focus on phonological awareness, phonics and word recognition, print concepts, and fluency. Students read decodable texts on grade level that are uniquely developed to provide intensive practice with the code. They develop speaking and listening skills by participating in presentation and group discussions. Skills units introduce new parts of language and follow an intentional structure which allows students to develop strong literacy skills across all language domains.

      Each section represents one lesson segment  of the CKLA Skills Strand lesson. All activities in this particular lesson focus on foundational skills except for the reading and additional support segments. Each has a video showing an example of how the lesson segment might look in the classroom, a breakdown explaining purpose of the segment, and key teaching materials and instructional guidance that are associated with that part of the lesson.

      Skills lessons frequently begin with a Warm-Up exercise. The Warm-Ups are intended to be quick reviews that help students focus for the lesson of the day. These are done orally and use multi-modality cuing and supports. It focus students on the sound or sounds that are addressed in the lesson. The Warm-Up can take different forms depending on which skills are focused on in the particular lesson.
    </p>
    <br>

      <br>  
    <h4>Vowels in Focus</h4>
    <p>
      Students review all vowel sounds they have learned in this unit as the Warm-Up for this lesson. As a new vowel sound is introduced in this lesson, the Warm-Up is focused on acclimating students to the sound and feel of the different vowel sounds. In this way the activity is helping students ground the knowledge they gained in the past by furthering their understanding by introducing new content or diving deeper into alternative usages or challenging parts of language.

        CKLA uses a systematic phonics approach that teaches students to read by blending. It is a sound-first approach where the most frequent sounds and sound-spellings are taught first to access text more rapidly. The exercises in this segment are often designed to juxtapose the different sounds to improve students’ ability to distinguish between them.
      </p>
        <br>
    <h4>Spotting the ‘ou’</h4>
    <p>
      This segment contains a listening exercise focusing on the /ou/ sound. Students first explore the "ou" sound by pronouncing it in varying voice pitches and volumes. The teacher reads different words containing this sound, taking care to clearly pronounce the part of the word containing the target sound. Lastly, in Sound Off, students identify the target sound in a short story they are read aloud. The short text to the left is an example of the text being read aloud for this lesson.

      Students begin to form a deeper understanding of the way the sound they are learning about is represented in written form through activities involving both the sound as well as the sound-spelling. They use their bodies to start writing out the letters representing the sound. The code chart will be used to track the sounds the class has learned while helping students understand the extent to which the sound has irregular spellings.
    </p>
      <br>
    <h4>Trace the Spelling</h4>
    <p>
      Students start out by tracing the spelling ‘ou’ on their tables while saying the sound. The teacher listens to evaluate students’ pronunciation  and tracing of the sound and spelling. Students also complete the section related to the target sound in their Individual Code Chart. There is a brief discussion about how the large powerbar means that the sound will be spelled with ‘ou’ most of the time.

      Having been introduced to the oral and written parts of the new sound students are prompted to practice writing words containing the sound. While practicing students will deepen their skill in writing the letters associated with the sound and using these letters to form words and sentences. Usually this practice is based on an activity page associated with the lesson.
    </p>
      <br>
    <h4>Ou, out, mouth</h4>
    <p>
      Students start their practice by writing and saying out loud the basic component of the sound of today's lesson: ‘ou’ on the activity page as seen on on the right. Afterwards they go on to write the words "out" and "mouth".

      Students engage with reading in almost every Skills lesson. Readers are 100% decodable, meaning they only use words and spellings that have been explicitly taught and practiced. Throughout the grades readers develop to contain increasing amounts of academic and domain specific words, demands for knowledge and words describing abstract or complex processes.
    </p>
      <br>
    <h4>Re-Reading to decode</h4>
    <p>
      In today's reading activity students reread the story "The Two Mules". Students often return to the same text multiple times in skills lessons. This in order to further and improve their decoding experience. In this story the newly introduced spellings  are underlined in order help students make the connection between the sound and spelling they have just learned. A Formative Assessment is part of this activity. By listening to students and taking notes systematically, the teacher will have a chance of better understanding how students are developing.

      Every Skills lesson concludes with an Additional Support section containing recommendations for 30 minutes of extended instruction and activities, directly aligned to the skills taught during primary instruction. Given the range of decoding abilities in a class the additional support exercises aim at addressing gaps in knowledge that students have.
    </p>
      <br>
    <h4>Word Chaining</h4>
    <p>
      In this lesson, students complete a  word chaining exercise. For this exercise students separate sound-spellings in a given word. They are prompted to change the spelling of the word so that a new word is formed. Chaining helps students with sound-spelling correspondences by requiring attention to individual sound-spelling changes as words are read or spelled. It reinforces students' ability to manipulate sounds in words in which only a single sound-spelling is changed, added, or deleted at a time. Chaining activities are completed by using a pocket chart with index cards, or by writing on a blackboard, whiteboard, Smart Board, or chart paper. The two chaining sequences for today's lesson can be seen here.
