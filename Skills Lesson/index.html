    <h3>Welcome!</h3> 
    <p> 
      In this 1st grade classroom, we'll take a closer look at a skills-focused, English Language Arts lesson which features a range of activities that reinforce and develop students' foundational letteracy skills. The activities focus on developing students' sense of the language through reading that are tailored to the students level, writing narrative, opinion and informational texts as well as supporting speaking and listening skills through presentation and group discussions. Skills units introduce new parts of the language and follow a consistent structure that allows students to develop strong literacy skills.
      <br> <br>

      Each section represents one of the parts of CKLA's Skills Strand lesson. Each has a video showing an example of how the lesson segment might look in the classroom, a breakdown explaining purpose of the segment, and key teaching materials and instructional guidance that are associated with that part of the lesson.

      <br>
      Note: Unlike Knowledge Lessons, there is not the same structure for the Skills lesson every day.

      Students begin each lesson with a Warm-Up actvity which on one hand is focussed on reviewing content from the previous lesson while leading up to the new concepts and skillsto be introduced later in the lesson. The Warm-Up can take many forms depending on which skills are in focus in the particular lesson. 
    </p>
    <br>
    


      <br>  
    <h4>Vo(uaeiy)wels</h4>
    <p>
      The class goes through all vowels they have learnt about as the Warm-Up for this class. As a new vowel sound is introduced in this lesson, the Warm-Up is focussed on aclimatising students to the sound and feel of the different vowel sounds. In this way the activity is helping students ground they knowledge they gained in the past while also becoming able to better understand the new knowledge they are to engage with throughout today's class.

        Students pronounce and listen to the sound of the lesson through different activities. The sound is first presented orally on its own and is afterwards gradually merged with the body of sounds the students already have been presented to. The exercises are often designed to juxtapose the new sound with the sounds students already know in order for them to better disntiguish between the different letters and sounds.
      </p>
        <br>
    <h4>Spotting the "OU"?</h4>
    <p>
      In this segment students first explore the "OU" sound by pronouncing it in varying voice pitches and volumes. The teacher then goes on to read out different words containing this sound, taking care to mark the part of the word containing the sound. Lastly, a short teaxt is read aloud and students have to touch their nose if their recognise the "OU" sound as being part of the word being read aloud. The short text to the left is an example of the text being read aloud for this lesson.

      Students start to form a deeper understanding of the way the sound they are learning about is represented in written form through activities involving both the oral and iconic form of the sound. They use their bodies to start writing out the letters representing the sound. The code chart will be used to track the sounds the class has learned about while helping the students understand the exstent to which the sound has irregular spellings.
    </p>
      <br>
    <h4>Trace the form of the sound on your table</h4>
    <p>
      The class start out by tracing the letters "OU" on their tables while saying the sound out loud. While doing this the teacher can listen in to get an idea of how well the students are pronouncing and tracing the sounds and letters. The students also fill out the section related to this lessons' sound in their code chart. There is a brief discussion about how the large powerbar means that the sound will be spelled with "OU" most of hte time.

      Having been introduced to the oral and written parts of the new sound students are prompted to practice writing words containing the sound. During this practice students will gain a deeper skill in writing the letters associated with the sound and using these letters to form words and sentences. Usually this practice is based on an activity page associated with the lesson.

      <br>
    <h4>Ou, out, mouth</h4>
    <p>
      Students start their practice by writing and saying out loud the basic componenet of the sound of today's class: "OU" on the activity page as seen on on the right. Afterwards they go on to write the words "out" and "mouth".

      Students engage with reading in almost every Skills lesson. They do so through readers which contains texts that are carefully sequenced to gradaully increase in complexity based on the other skills that students develop in and outside of class. Throughout the grades readers develop t ocontain increasing amounts of academic and domain specific words, demand for knowledge and words describing abstract or complex processes.

      <br>
    <h4>Now how does "ou" appear?</h4>
    <p>
      In today's reading activity students are going to reread the story "The Two Mules". Students
      often return to the same text multiple times in skills lessons. This in order to further and improve their decoding experience. In this story the letters corresponding to the "ou" sound are underlined in order help students make the connection between the sound and spelling they have just learned about. A Formative Sssessment is part of this activity. By listening to students and taking notes sytematically the teacher will have a chance of better understanding how their students are developing.
