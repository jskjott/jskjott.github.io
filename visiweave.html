						<p>This project is a braiding of two lines of research</p>
<ul>
<li>an exploration of what it means to experience computing as being embedded in a communal, cultural, and spatial fabric.</li>
<li>the development of a design medium and environment for paper weaving</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-does-it-me-mean-for-computing-to-be-embedded-in-a-communal-cultural-and-spatial-fabric">What does it me mean for computing to be embedded in a communal, cultural, and spatial fabric?</h3>
<p><a href="http://jskjott.com/presentations/Spreadsheets_as_Notational_Environment_for_Paper_Weaving_Presentation.pdf">slides</a>・from a presentation on this project at Convivial Computing Salon</p>
<p>At my home the process of weaving a heart is a social and spatial affair. A process where the paper weaving designs I make interact spatially with the ones woven by my great grandfather.</p>
<p>VisiWeave resulted from a process situated in a cultural, communal, and historical context. It is part of a deep network of culture and history.</p>
<p>In his book Tools for Conviviality (1973) Ivan Illich (1926 - 2002) talked of conviviality as a communal practice existing in space “I choose the term &#39;conviviality&#39; to designate the ... autonomous and creative intercourse among persons, and of persons with their environment.”</p>
<p>I feel that the conviviality of VisiWeave is directly tied to my ability to articulate the space and community the tool is embedded in and grew out of.</p>
<p>The design of VisiWeave grew out of a living cultural practice. Conviviality is embedded in process - it is local and situated - and, for me, represents one path forward where computational tools are created with a consciousness of the historical and cultural environment.</p>
<h3 id="a-design-medium-and-environment-for-paper-weaving">A design medium and environment for paper weaving</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Weaving is a binary art - Heinz Zemanek</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.visiweave.com">visiweave.com</a>・a prototype environment
<a href="https://github.com/jskjott/visiweave">github</a>・repo for the environment</p>
<p>The design of this medium flows from the notion that embracing computational media can enrich the practice of paper weaving.</p>
<p>It is inspired in spirit and practice by work within the fields computational weaving, computational origami, and paper mechatronics.</p>
<p>There are many challenges associcated with paper weaving design. A significant barrier is how one is often forced to work with several representations at the same time. For example, one often has to work with the componenent pieces of a weaving design while thinking about what the final interlacement of the pieces will look like.</p>
<p>VisiWeave adresses this challenge by making it possible to work directly with the final, woven, representation of the design.</p>
