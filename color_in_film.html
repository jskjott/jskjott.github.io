<p>I always liked thinking about how color is used to generate various experieces in film. Based on this interest, a friend and I decided to try to model the change of color in feature films. Our model&#39;s output was a colour timeline like the one seen below. Each point in a colour timeline represent the average colour of the film at that point. The point approximately covers a 10 second window.</p>

<p>The colour seen at each point in the timeline above is composed of a particular, hue, saturation and lightness. If these variables are separated and graphed independently then you get a timeline which looks like the one seen below.</p>

<p>In this visualisation the hue is shown at the background of the plot, the saturation shown as a black line, and the lightness as a white line. Hue is a cyclical data type which makes it inappropriate in the line plot form that saturation and lightness take. Therefore we plot it as the background.</p>
<p>In our model, hue, saturation and lightness change slightly most of the time, and change greatly quite rarely. The small changes seeks to capture the gradual changes happening within a scene or arc of a movie. The large changes represent either a mood or scene change in the movie. We decided to have the concepts of a slight change and a major change because the scale of change and the frequency of these two are very different. For a scene change the hue might jump thirty values in the 360 values wide space between two frame, a change that might take thousands of steps with small changes. This is similar when looking at saturation or lightness.</p>
<h4 id="the-models-state-consists-of">The model’s state consists of:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The average colour of the frame, broken down into ​hue ​(angle in degrees), ​saturation
(from 0 to 1), and ​lightness​ (from 0 to 1)</li>
<li>The ​steps_since_direction_change​ (integer)</li>
<li>The ​saturation_gradient​ (angle in radians), which the saturation will follow</li>
<li>The ​independent_lightness ​(from 0 to 1), which is combined with the inverse of
saturation to calculate lightness</li>
</ul>
<p>We did some validation of the model by comparing with indepedently chosen movies. Example of such comparison is below: the blue dots represent the controls and the red dots the generated movies.</p>
