#### EXPERIENCE

### **Recurse Center, participant** — Aug 2019 - Present

Got time and space to work on projects as part of a self-directed educational retreat for programmers.

- Created a git-based [version control tool for filmmakers](https://github.com/jskjott/git-for-filmmakers) using Electron, Typescript, and Vue.js. 
- Made an [audio sequencer](https://github.com/jskjott/casette) to use with live coding environments such as TidalCycles or VCV Rack. I connected my sequencer to these tools with web MIDI and OSC (open sound control).
- Created a [realtime midi sound visualisation tool](https://github.com/jskjott/midi-plotter) with Rust. The code has a multithreaded structure in which one thread listens for midi input, and another thread draws what is received.

### **Freelance,  front-end developer** — April - July 2019

Worked as part of a small team to build a browser extension and an Electron app.

- Used socket.io to create an API allowing wave interactions, messages, and group information to be sent between clients and the server.
- Used Chrome’s and Firefox’s extension APIs to create an extension supported across browsers. We structured the extension so that we were able to produce a firefox and chrome version based on one codebase; by doing this, we avoided having to work with two production environments.
- Aided migration from Javascript to Typescript by adding strict types to the existing codebase. After the migration, the number of bugs decreased, and the onboarding process of new programmers became shorter because of Typescript self-documenting nature.

### **Digital Creativity Labs, service design intern** — June - August 2018

As a service designer, my job was to better the user journey associated with the lab’s citizen science programs. 

- Designed legible data collection forms to improve the overall participant experience. 
- Designed and conducted graph literacy assessment with program participants.
- Prototyped new group exercises.
Iterated on prototypes on-site with Kenyan farmers.
