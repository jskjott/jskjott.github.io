The ways that community is experienced online felt inadequate to one of my friends and me. We wanted to extend the experience of physically living in a community to the experience we had on the internet.<br>
We wanted to break the assumption that you are alone online when you are not on social media. Therefore, we decided that we wanted to make a browser extension for communities, aiming to make browsing more fun, exciting, and to create a stronger sense of communal presence online.<br>

<br>The extension is an incomplete implementation of some of the ideas Vannevar Bush explored in “As We May Think”: the idea that we make a trail through the knowledge we engage with and that it is powerful if we can realise when our trails meet. For this project, I wrote roughly 40% of the code for the extension using JavaScript. I also created the visual identity of the project.

> “Sometimes, when I’m filling out a shitty visa form, seeing others have been there is quite comforting, or when I’m reading an article, seeing that someone else read it recently is a great excuse to start a conversation. I think it brings a lot of the aspects of an offline community into your on- line experience, and that’s really nice.”
