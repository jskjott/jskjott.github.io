## Quotes

**HERBERT SIMON** (in The Sciences of the Artificial)

> All mathematics exhibits in its conclusions only what is already implicit in its premisesâ€¦ Hence all mathematical derivation can be viewed simply as chase in representation, making evident what was previously true but obscure.

> This view can be extended to all of problem solving-solving a problem simply means repenting it so as to make the solution transparent. If the problem solving could actually be organised in these terms, the issue of representation would indeed become central. But even if it cannot-if this is too exaggerated a view-a deeper understanding of how representations are created and how they contribute to the solution of problems will become an essential component of the future theory of design.

**ENGELBART**

> Manipulating words seemed like thoe obvious place to start because it was a way to manipulate your ideas.

**DEVINE**

> Optimizing toward the need for less revenue has yielded better results than optimizing toward the generation of more.

> The goal is to build a catalog of exciting things to wake up to the next day and to experiment with.
