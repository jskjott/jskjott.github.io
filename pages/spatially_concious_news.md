### Providing Spatially Conscious News

I think that there are so many ways people aren’t aware of the filter bubbles they are in. This is particularly true of the news people digest and I wanted to, in some way, create greater awareness of this by embeding knowledge of what is and what is not represented in the experience of reading news.

This was a personal project. I first explored different ways of digesting news ranging from social media to sites which intentionally provide news articles from outlets with contrasting political stances. I then decided to focus on news interfaces: the tools which gives users an overview of the space of news articles which are available for reading.

The news interface I made embedded an awareness of geographical biases in the search functionality by showing a world map were each country is sized proportionally to the amount of news available about that area. I the user wants more or less information about that country they change the size of it on the map. I used JavaScript, Vue.js, D3.js together with the Google News API to make my prototype.
